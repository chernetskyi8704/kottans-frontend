<summary> 0. Git Basics </summary>
  
  #### I have never dealt with Git/Github before, the initial commands are quite understandable, but the juggling of commits and work with remote repositories are more complicated and require more time to understand, but I hope that with practice, my skills will become better.
  #### In practice, everything turned out to be three times more complicated, especially when you solve conflicts through your irreverence, which as a result generates new conflicts, so it was a good lesson for me to recheck everything twice. Despite all the difficulties, I enjoyed working with Git and Github. ðŸ™‚

<summary> 1. Linux CLI, and HTTP </summary>
  
### Linux Survival (4 modules):
 #### In general, I was already familiar with the commands that were shown in the first 2 modules, but I did not use them often enough, so it was useful to practice them again. The commands, which were demonstrated in module 3/4 were new to me and and require more practice to use them comfortably.

#### I liked the visualization that was demonstrated in this resource, which allows you to better understand the result of each command. In the future, it will be useful to check it out again and refresh my knowledge.

### HTTP: The Protocol Every Web Developer Must Know (Part 1,2):
  
  #### A lot of new and already known to me theoretical material, which is unlikely to be 100% remains in your memory after reading, for better understanding I watched the additional videos and noted the main aspects. If it will be necessary in the future I will repeatedly return to the educational material and my notes as well.

    <summary> 2. Git Collaboration </summary>

#### 3/4 week was super informative, I have learned a lot of useful things. The "git rebase -i" very surprised me, it's really useful command, which allows you to do many things with the commits. In the future, I will repeatedly return to the educational material and my notes as well.

## Front-End Basics

<details> 
    <summary> 3. Intro to HTML & CSS </summary>

  #### I was already familiar with the 90% material that was presented, but the first time I have met with the Bootstrap Library. All in all, it was a perfect material to refresh my knowledge and learn some new stuff.

<details> 
    <summary> 4. Responsive Web Design </summary>

  #### Previously, I was already familiar with Flexbox/Grid thanks to this YouTube channel, I like his clear explanation with practical examples, by the way, I often use his Flexbox/Grid cheat sheets. It was helpful for me to review this material again. Also on his channel, there is a good explanation about responsive web design. 

  #### Very cool games, they are a great addition to learning the Flexbox/Grid. I happily would return to them to refresh my knowledge.

    <!-- -----------------------------------------HTML & CSS Practice-------------------------------------------------------------- -->
    <details> 
    <summary> 5. HTML & CSS - Practice </summary>

#### At first glance, it seems to be a very simple task, but when you start to do it, you will realize that it is not. I didn't pay much attention to HTML/CSS, I was more into JS, but now I understand that it was a huge mistake. I like this one practice I will continue practicing and improving my HTML/CSS skills.

    <summary> 6. JavaScript Basics </summary>
  
#### I had repeated what I had learned before and learned enough new things, some things were easy, and some things were difficult and took more time to understand. I like working with Map, Filter, and Reduce so much, they make writing and reading code much more accessible.

#### Algorithm Scripting Challenges 12-18: quite difficult tasks unlike the previous ones, some of them were relatively easy, and in some of them I used prompts to resolve them. There is something to work on to improve my knowledge and skills.

#### The practical task was not very difficult, I enjoyed using the knowledge I gained. Most of my time was taken up by the implementation of the architecture itself and the creation of at least some design.
